CLEARING LAND
Preparation of land is a beautiful concept that God has desired to teach human beings about clearing their hearts from sin,
the Bible says, in Hosea 10:12 "Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you."
and also God says, in Isaiah 5:2, "And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and 
built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes."
so it is a wise thing to learn this skill of preparing the land, because it is awesome and very intriguing lesson. First of all clearing of the land is not an 
easy concept because it involves a lot of energy. The preparation of land is actually meant to be like that, because clearing the heart of sin is not an
easy thing and any one can attest to that. One thing you shall come to learn is that farming is a very interesting field because one can learn many concepts from
the Bible. Did you know that it is God's desire that we all become farmers, check out this verse, "And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
But it is not an easy truth to learn, I pray that God may help us to understand that truth.

There is a technique that God uses for clearing the land and that can be gotten from the book of Isaiah 5:2, it is that when preparing the land one needs to 
learn how to uproot the wild plants, clear the stones, prepare the soil and then plant the crop.


a) Land clearing
Land clearing is the process of removing trees, stumps, brush, stones, weeds, and other obstacles from an area as requested in order to increase the size of crop producing land based on a farm that is already existing or provide land for a new farm operation. And this land should be prepared to meet the crop rotation, soil conservation goals (i.e composting and mulching) that one has in mind.
In the clearing of land we need to develop a plan, some of the benefits that come along with planning the clearing of land are: 
Avoiding unnecessary loss of energy and money, leading to discouragement.
Determining how many trees or components need to be cleared out of the way.
Determining how much space one may need for performing their tasks in that land.
Determining which type of crops or livestock to grow in that land.
Clearing principles
These are guidelines to consider when intending to clear land:

Divide the land into quadrants, and sections. It all depends on what one wants to accomplish, such as clearing trees, brush, and underbrush, fertilizing the land, or removing stumps.
Then we now need to remove any vegetation, trees, stumps, brush and underbrush on the land. If the land is covered with lots of weeds and grasses, then it has insufficient nutrients hence the need to restore the land.
Depending on the plants on the ground, different tools will be needed in removing them.
The timber collected can be dried up and used for wood work purposes in the farm or house.
Land should not be cleared on steep slopes unless it can be fully integrated within an existing erosion control (terracing) conservation system to prevent erosion from the affected area.

Land clearing methods should limit the loss of topsoil removed from the area being cleared. The top soil is rich in nutrients and microbial organisms essential for healthy plant life.

The land should be sufficiently level to permit the normal operation of farm equipment and the area must be ready for seed bed preparation.


Land clearing process
Cut down unnecessary trees
Clear large rocks
Dig up tree stumps
Clear any brush or weeds
Level the land

Cut down unnecessary trees
For this process we will use a hand axe.

Inspect your axe before you use it. You need to inspect your handle for any cracks. If you see any cracks or defects in the wood, then you will need to replace the handle. Check the head for rust, dirt, and any burrs in the metal.
If your axe needs sharpening, be sure to do that first. A dull axe will not only take longer to fell the tree, it can also be dangerous! Be sure to clean the head of the axe before sharpening it.
To clean the head of the axe you need to remove any dirt or rust, do this with steel wool or sandpaper. 

Sharpening the axe head:
Place the axe on a surface i.e table or bench. Push the axe head a few centimeters (about 10cm) to the edge of the surface so that the cutting edge of the axe is suspended in the air to allow you to file.
Place a wooden wedge under head to lift the bit away from the table, as well as to add stability.
Hold the file handle in the palm of your dominant hand, with your thumb resting on top. Curl the fingers of your other hand around the tip of the file.
Stand with one foot well in front of the other so you can use your shoulders to push the file. To prevent the file from rocking back and forth, lead with your forward hand, then transfer smoothly to a push with the handle by the end of the stroke. 
Incline the file at an angle of 25 degrees which is a good angle to aim for.
Push the file over the bit to create a sharp cutting edge. Use the file to create the new cutting edge. Each stroke of the file will remove some metal.
When you reach your desired sharpness, turn to the other side and repeat the steps.
Do your best to keep both sides even.
To know whether your axe is sharpened well it should be between 25-30 (degrees) angle.

Felling The Tree:
Select the direction you want the tree to fall.
Grasp the handle of the axe with your less dominant hand at the base and place the other slightly further up about 30cm.
Stand at an arm’s length distance from the tree or about 60cm.
Start to notch the tree at about 2 feet from ground level . Cut a 45 degree angle to start the notch.
Chop 45 degrees downward for the top of the notch and then move up the tree just a bit, and chop 45 degrees downward again. Making your notch like this will allow you to cut deeper into the tree.
Cut about ½ of the way through the tree. Go around to the other side of the tree and do the same just a few inches higher than the first notch you made.
The wood between the two notches will make your hinge. The hinge helps to hold the tree
in place as it starts to fall, and helps to prevent kick back off of the stump.
Continue to chop downward from the back notch working toward the felling notch at the front of the tree. This will start the tree to fall.
Once the tree starts to fall use your designated escape route for safety.
Cutting through the back notch into the felling notch is the safer method as when the tree goes to fall you will not be in the way. 

Clear large rocks
A pickaxe can be used to remove large stones and rocks from a landscape to clear the area, by breaking up these hard materials. Containing a large chisel head constructed out of metal, the pick axe also features a 12-inch wooden handle used for gripping the tool easily while bringing down the tool's large metal chisel onto the stone's surface. Since the pickaxe is designed in a compact and powerful fashion, this tool is good for smashing apart rocks to take them out of the ground fairly easily.
Steps:
i. using the pick end (on the surface of the rock).
You should stand with the object you are trying to hit set slightly in front of you about 60cm or an arm’s length distance, so as not to bring the head of the pickaxe down too close to your feet.
Grasp the handle with your less dominant hand at the base and place the other slightly further up about 30cm.
Bend at the waist, keeping your back straight, knees flexed, and feet shoulder-width apart with one foot slightly in front of the other.
As you swing the head of the pickaxe down, extend your arms, keeping your eye on the object you are trying to hit.
Keep a firm grip of the handle as you strike to prevent it slipping from your grasp.
Hit the surface of the rock at an angle of 90 degrees.

ii. using chisel end

Wedge the chisel end of the pick axe head into a crack, and, using the handle of the pick axe as a lever, pull the handle back to rise apart the rock.
To lift the rock with the chisel of a pick axe, strike the chisel into the ground just in front of the rock then pull the handle of the pick axe back to lever up the rock. 
To dislodge fully or partially submerged rocks, dig around the rock using a shovel with a spade end as it can also be used to leverage the rock from its position once surrounding soil has been removed.
For rock that is set in hard packed soil, use of a mattock or pick axe can be used to break up the soil.
Using the shovel to dig around the rock:

Grasp the handle with your less dominant hand at the base and place the other slightly further up about 30cm.
Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and have your shoulders and hips facing towards your spade. Keep the spade vertical, holding the handle with both hands, and push the blade into the ground using your foot.
Maintain a straight back while carefully levering the blade by lowering the handle towards you to an angle of about 45 degrees.
Bend your knees and slide one hand down the handle then lift the soil on the blade. Avoid muscle strains by depositing the soil a few paces away rather than twisting your torso to discard the soil.


Smaller rocks
One can use a heavy-duty Rake Since certain landscapes that require clearing can contain small rocks, large sections of dead grass, tree branches and twigs that are buried into the soil itself, a heavy-duty rake is a good tool to use to get rid of this debris.
steps:
Grasp the handle with your less dominant hand at the base and place the other slightly further up about 30cm.
Bend at the waist, keeping your back straight, knees flexed, and feet shoulder-width apart with one foot slightly in front of the other.
Press down the sharpened tines into the earth's soil holding the rake at a 45 degrees angle.
Pull back the rake through the ground to break the soil as you walk backwards.
Pick up the small stones and pile them up in a section where you will collect with a shovel and load on a wheelbarrow at a later time.

Dig up tree stumps
This goal will be accomplished using a cutter mattock.
To remove a tree stump completely, you will have to remove two distinct root systems:
 Lateral roots that radiate from the stump just beneath the soil
 The taproot which travels straight down from the stump.
To get started, move any brush away from the stump with a garden rake to give yourself a clear working area.
Then use the mattock head to break up the soil and pull it away from the stump. Locate the lateral roots and pull the dirt away from them as well.
Next, use the cutter head to sever each of the lateral roots as follows:
i. Grasp the handle about halfway up with your dominant hand and place the other at the base.
ii. Bend at the waist, keeping your back straight, knees flexed, and feet shoulder-width apart with one foot slightly forward.
iii. Maintain a distance of about 100cm from the target root.
iv. Raise the head of the mattock up to just above waist height and let the weight of the tool bring the head falling onto the root in an arc at a 90 degrees angle.

Each root may take several swings to cut all the way though. To confirm that it is severed, use the mattock head to pry up the section of root no longer connected to the stump.
At this point you can simply sever the taproot if the stump is only an inch or two in diameter.
Two additional steps are necessary for larger taproots:
First, enough soil must be removed with a shovel to expose the taproot and allow the stump enough room to rock back and forth in the hole. Secondly, and most importantly, the stump needs to be split into smaller pieces. 
Digging around the stump provides the room necessary to split the stump vertically into 2 or 4 pieces. Once sufficiently split, the individual sections can then be stepped on and forced away from the middle of the stump. Smaller pieces will simply break off under pressure, making more room to work on larger sections with the cutter head. A 6-inch stump can be removed in around 10 minutes.

Clear any brush or weeds and grasses (I think it is good for one to define the type of weeds to clear)
In this step, first we need to begin with uprooting weeds which are mostly invasive when not put under control. These can be removed by pulling them from the ground with the hands. However if the land is large, cutting them down together with grasses is most convenient.
For soft grasses and reeds, a sharp slasher used in a side-to-side motion will work sufficiently.
Steps:
Hold the slasher in your dominant hand.
Your grip should be loose but well-controlled. Grip the slasher tightly enough to keep it secure in your hands, but keep your hands free of tension.
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. Your non-dominant foot should be in front, or closer to the target area about 40cm from your foot.
Begin your backswing by gradually shifting your weight to your back foot. Just before you start rotating your body, raise your arms back slightly in a straight line. In a single, continuous motion, rotate your arm, shoulder, and hip backward.
Keep your arm fully extended as you rotate into your backswing. Once your slasher is around shoulder height, bend your wrist to hinge your hands and raise the slasher up higher. This will help you generate a more powerful swing.
Swing your dominant hand with the slasher at about 130 degree angle and aim it at the grass in front of your feet bringing the slasher down with enough force to cut the grass.
Repeat this process by swinging the slasher from side to side to cut the grass hitting it at the base touching the ground.

For denser growth such as vines, a brush clearing machete is best. This variation on the standard machete is essentially a multi-tool with double-sided blades for slicing and hacking as well as a hooked end blade for especially thick foliage.
Steps:
Finding the correct grip is fundamental for an efficient machete swing. 
With the Machete in hand, you start by wrapping your thumb and forefinger around opposite sides of the handle and pinching them together tightly.
Your other three fingers only need to be wrapped loosely around the base of the handle.
It may seem counter-intuitive, however the handle should actually have a little play within your palm, and be able to wiggle around slightly. A common beginner’s mistake is to grip the handle so tight that you leave a palm print. There is no need for that.
First, when you swing the machete, start higher and direct your whole arm in a downward direction to increase momentum. You will also have the weight of the machete and gravity on your side.
your target should be about an arm’s length distance from your body and the machete should hit your target at a 45 degrees angle.
You should also bring your shoulder down as you swing. This ensures that the momentum of your core is actually the main power supply, generating the thrust that flows through your arm and into the tool.
It is important to allow your elbow to lead the direction of the swing.
Upon contact with the material you are cutting, try to flick your wrist slightly. Woody vegetation requires a downward flick, while grass and leafy growth should be met with an upwards flick.
With the grip and the swing in place, the last thing you need to nail is the angle of the blade as you hit the material being cut. 


making straw bales

Straw bales are a good component for doing so many things, for instance:

building
mulching
compost

This is a really helpful item within a farm, for one needs structures, or plant protection from weeds, or manufacturing their own fertilizer. I shall outline some simple steps of how to make straw bales by hand,

step 1  - clear grass that has been growing and is long enough.
step 2  - dry the grass if it has not yet been dried, but incase one lives in a dry region, there is a possibility that the grass is dry enough, this can be proven by cutting the grass, there is a sound that dry grass shall make and in that case there is no need for drying up the grass.
step 3 - cut two bale stripes (thin string-like materials) and lay them inside a cardboard box, or rubber bin, or any hard box like material, like 20 - 25 cm apart depending on the boxes being used.
step 4  - fill the boxes with straw and try to compress them as much as you possibly can, then tie the strings as tightly as you possibly can or within your limits.
step 5 - remove the bale from the box and repeat the process again to make more bales. 

This is an effective way of making bales and is very cheap. There are baling machines, but in case one may not have one, this is a very good and fun exercise to engage in.
