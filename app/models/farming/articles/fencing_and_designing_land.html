Modern landscaping concepts, methods and techniques, have
really ruined the natural order of living organisms and the original plan. If I would ask for a wish to be fulfilled when righting
this article, it would be to see how the garden of eden was designed, and mimic the entire garden to the 
best of my knowledge. I believe that Adam was not told to redesign the garden but instead to enhance it, and train the
bowers to follow his biddings. Like the way an artist can take paint and paint brush and draw purely out of their imagination, or an architect
the ability to design a fancy house, or an engineer to design a sophisticated machine, or a programmer to design a system,
so has God given man the ability and opportunity to design their land by train the seedlings to form beatiful canopies, by 
rotating the crops in a systematic manner or order or cycles.

I would be glad to have you guys accompany me in this journey of learning about this design principles of designing a garden and building
beautiful fences. It is an awesome lesson and would be a really great opportunity to learn some more.
